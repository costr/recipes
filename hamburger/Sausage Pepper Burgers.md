## Ingredients:

- 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 2 Red Bell Peppers, Sliced (Julienned)
- 1 Large Onion, Sliced (Julienned)
- 1 tsp Kosher Salt
- 1 tsp Black pepper
- 3 Garlic Cloves, Sliced
- 1/2 Cup Pizza Sauce (Contadina Pizza Sauce)
- 2 lbs Ground Beef (80/20)
- 1 lb Sweet Italian sausage
- 1/2 tsp Dried oregano
- 6 Sliced of provolone
- 6 Semolina Rolls, split and toasted (we've never found them so we just go with fresh rolls)
- Torn fresh basil (for topping)

## Directions
- Preheat a grill to medium. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add the peppers onion, season with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently until lightly browned and just tender, 8 - 10 min. Add the garlic and cook until just softened, about 1 more minute. Stire in the pizza sauce and 1/2 cup of water. Simmer until thickened but still saucy, about 5 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.
- Combine beef, sausage, sage, oregano, and 1 tsp each salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Form into 6 1-inch-thick patties. Season patties with salt and pepper.
- Grill burgers until cooked through, 6 - 7 minutes per side; top each witha slice of provolone cheese during the last 1 - 2 minutes and cover to melt. Server the burgers on the rolls and top with the pepper mixture and basil.
