# Turkey Cooking Tips #

## Alton Browns Cooking Methodology ##

1. Take turkey out of brine, wash, dry, and let rest to room temp for 60 minutes
2. Preheat the oven to 500F, set oven rack to 2nd lowest level
3. Pat dry your turkey, a dryer turkey browns more evenly
4. Once dry, take aluminum foil and create a tent that covers the breast neck to thighs but doesn't cover the legs, triangle shaped, and coat the foil with canola oil
5. Rub the turkey with canola oil, to promote browning
6. Insert a meat thermometer into the deepest part of the white meat of the breast
7. Insert the turkey, legs first, in the oven and cook, at 500F, for 30 minutes
8. Remove the turkey and quickly, to not toast your fingers, cover the breast with the foil from step 3
9. Lower the oven temperature to 350F
10. Put the turkey back in the oven and cook until 161F
11. A 14lb turkey should take about an additional 1.5 hours to reach 161F
12. Remove and let rest, covered, for 15 minutes

## Misc Notes ##

1. Turkey cook times can swing 30 - 60 minutes
2. Turkey will stay hot/warm for a long time; use this to plan ahead and cook to be done earlier than you plan to eat
